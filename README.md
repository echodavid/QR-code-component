## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use css variables to make the code more readable and easier to maintain. I also learned how to use classes to make the code more reusable.
```css
.flex-container{
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn mobile-first workflow and how to make the code more reusable. I also want to learn how to make a website more accessible and responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Emmet Documentation](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/) - This helped me for the Emmet abbreviations. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
